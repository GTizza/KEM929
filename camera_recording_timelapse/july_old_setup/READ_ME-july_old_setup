Old setup with still some flaws. We have used OBS autoexposure, which changes the exposure during the video recording throughout time (which might be detrimental for a stable image aquisition), and there might be reflections in the bottom heating plate.
Bubbles are a problems and the straw, even if it convenient for the casting of the gel, is not the best option for the recording, because it limits the analysable area to a small circle in the middle of the frame.
