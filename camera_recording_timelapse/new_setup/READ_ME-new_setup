We have used OBS manual exposure, which does not change the exposure during the video recording throughout time (for a stable image aquisition)
There are no reflections on the bottom heating plate because we used a white paper to have an homogeneous backgroud behind the captured video of the gel.
Bubbles are a little problem but it is a struggle to remove them during the experiment. Masking them out afterwards seems the most viable option.
The gel is casted directly on the concavity of the probe in front of the camera, which is 2 mm thick.
